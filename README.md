# AI-Bloom-Classifier
Project objective:
Demonstrate how artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques can be used to classify images intelligently and effectively using easy-to-use tools like Teachable Machine and Google Colab.

Project Idea:
The project uses a trained artificial intelligence model to identify the type of flower in an image, determining whether it is a joury or a tulip.

What exactly does the project do?
1. The model is trained using Google's Teachable Machine on images of two flower classes: Damask roses and Tulips.
2. The model is uploaded to Google Colab:
The files are uploaded:
* keras_model.h5 (model file)
* labels.txt (contains the class names)
* Blossom.jpg (test image)
3. The code is run in Google Colab:
* Uploads the image
* Resizes it to fit the model
* Passes it to the model for classification
* Prints the class name (Tulip or Damask rose) and the confidence level of the prediction
 

Why is your project useful?

1. It demonstrates a practical application of artificial intelligence

• The project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to accurately classify images.

• Instead of humans having to identify flower types, the model automatically identifies them.

⸻

2. It relies on real images

• It can be used in educational, agricultural, or even smart camera applications.

• The model is able to distinguish between flower types with just a single image.

⸻

3. It simplifies the concept of machine learning for beginners

• Using tools like Teachable Machine and Google Colab makes the project suitable for beginners to understand how a model is trained and classified.

⸻

4. Scalable

• You can easily expand the project later to include:

• Classifying more flower types

• Using a live camera

• Integrating it with a mobile app

⸻

5. Implements the concept of intelligent automation

• This type of project can be used to automate tasks such as:

• Classifying plants in a garden

• Educational applications for children

• Supporting the blind with visual object recognition
